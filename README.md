## Maze Runner
What started out as a project to get better at 2D maze generation and was supposed to be a simple game in where you run in labyrinths as fast as possible. Ended up becoming a 3D cube maze generator (currently not used in a game sense yet)

### First version of maze generation
The first version of the maze generator allowed for real-time generation (slow but pretty looking)
